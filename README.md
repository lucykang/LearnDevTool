# projectCoffee

Just some personal repo to study some build tools like gulp, browserify, webpack and front-end frameworks like react, react-bootstrap and so on.
The tutorial I'm following is https://www.toptal.com/front-end/webpack-browserify-gulp-which-is-better

**As of Feb 14th 2017**
Branch: gulp-browserify-setup is done so far and can be cloned and tested.
