# Learn Dev Tool

Just some personal repo to study some build tools like gulp, browserify, webpack and front-end frameworks like react, react-bootstrap and so on. The tutorial I'm following is [Webpack or Browserify & Gulp: Which Is Better](https://www.toptal.com/front-end/webpack-browserify-gulp-which-is-better)

### About Browserify
Bundler for npm packages to be used in the browser. Since there's no minifying, linting or task runner functionality, it is being used with grunt or gulp often.
This Node-centric philosophy has a number of benefits; bundling an app with Browserify is simple, you can using built-in Node modules like path, and you can use any code youâ€™ve written for Node as is.
